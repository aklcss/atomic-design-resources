List of resources for understanding and implementing Atomic Design

- [Atomic Design Book](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) by Brad Frost - Where it all started.

## Live examples

Pattern library and living styleguide are products of Atomic Design. Many companies publish theirs online to create a consistent understanding internally and among their partners.

- [Lonely Planet's Styleguide](https://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/) is easy on the eyes, shows little code snippets, and explain the purpose of each documented element very clearly. Good for both designers and developers who work on their platform.
- [Mailchimp's Pattern Library](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/) is a byproduct of their 'move to a more responsive, nimble, & intuitive app'. Another easy on the eyes reference.
- [BBC GEL](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/design-patterns) was the pioneering pattern library, and was one of the most comprehensive out there. This one is very design focused with no code examples.

## Where to start?

Your next, or current project even!

Start small, with simple things like form elements, buttons and typography. If you're writing decent CSS, you'll notice that a lot these elements are already quite reusable. Split them into different files, write a whole load of comments and start documenting.

- [Patternlab](http://patternlab.io/) can help you document your atomic patterns
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) in itself is already a pattern library. Look at their example, and make one for yourself! Everyone should have their own bootstrap.
